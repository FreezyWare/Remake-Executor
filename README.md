# Universal Roblox Executor (Code)
This project is a universal script executor for Roblox, designed to work across all games that use the Roblox Studios GUI. This version includes several improvements over previous versions, such as enhanced optimization and rewritten components for maximum efficiency.

The source code of this project is optimized, organized, and simplified to be fast, stable, and precise. (I mean I am not lying tho)

This project is currently in beta testing. Feel free to create pull requests (you will get credited), report issues, or contact me on any of my linked platforms.
